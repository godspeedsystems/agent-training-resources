# Training Process for Godspeed GPT Model

## 1. Initial Inquiry on Godspeed Knowledge

- Begin by asking if the model has any prior information about "Godspeed."
- If not, proceed to upload relevant documentation and files for the GPT to learn.

## 2. Providing Godspeed Documentation URL

- Share the URL for Godspeed documentation to give the model a foundational understanding.
- Use this as a reference to ensure it can pull responses that align with official Godspeed guidelines and principles.

## 3. Setting Objective for Response Quality

- Specify that the goal is to have the model respond in line with the Godspeed meta-framework.
- Emphasize accuracy, adherence to Godspeed's terminologies, and response structure.

## 4. File Upload and Documentation Feeding Process

- Sequentially upload various types of documentation to build a comprehensive knowledge base in GPT.

### 4.1 Upload Full Godspeed Documentation (Markdown File)

- **4.1.1 Prompting:** Instruct the model to refer to this documentation when generating responses.
- **4.1.2 Specific Instruction:** Guide the model to always include "Godspeed Guardrails" in responses, especially when explaining what Godspeed is.
- **4.1.3 Testing Coverage:** Test the model's response accuracy by asking questions about how Godspeed functions, plugin integration, event sources, and other core concepts.

### 4.2 Upload File with Essential Godspeed Plugin Data

- Ensure the model understands plugin integration by adding comprehensive details about all available plugins in Godspeed.

### 4.3 Upload Complete Code for gs-node-service

- Provides an in-depth reference for the model to understand practical code implementations within Godspeed.

### 4.4 Upload Complete Godspeed Project Code

- **4.4.1 Prompting for Full Context:** Specify that this file provides a complete view of Godspeed's architecture, emphasizing that responses should leverage this file for in-depth explanations.
- **Testing Scope:** After uploading, test the model’s responses on topics like creating events, setting up plugins, and understanding workflows in Godspeed.

### 4.5 Upload Prompt File Provided by Ayush

- **4.5.1 Prompt Before Answering:** Guide the model to consult this prompt file before responding to ensure context alignment.
- **4.5.2 Builder Integration:** Emphasize including data from this prompt file in response-building.

### 4.6 Upload Context File for GS Workflow Creation

- **4.6.1 TypeScript Workflow Priority:** Indicate to the model to prioritize TypeScript workflows.
- **4.6.2 Testing and Adjustment:** Conduct tests specifically on workflow-related responses. If the model provides out-of-context answers, give corrective feedback for accuracy.

## 5. Iteration and Correction Process

- **Step-by-Step Testing:** After each file upload and prompt instruction, conduct thorough testing by asking specific questions related to the uploaded content.
- **Feedback for Out-of-Context Responses:** If responses deviate, provide precise feedback and additional prompts to recalibrate the model’s understanding.

## 6. Prompt Reinforcement and Knowledge Verification

- Use the prompt file and Godspeed documentation to refine the model’s responses further, ensuring all explanations align with Godspeed’s framework and terminology.
- Reiterate critical instructions on answering accurately about Godspeed’s core concepts, like plugins, workflows, and event sources, by referencing the detailed documentation.
